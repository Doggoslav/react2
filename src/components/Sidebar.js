    <h2>What is this webpage about?</h2>
    <p>This page deals with skins with special patterns that are somehow significantly different from normal skins.</p>
    <h2>Why was this webpage created?</h2>
    <p>It was for several reasons, very often I saw that people out of ignorance sold really rare items for a small price, people were not able to find information about rare patterns on the Internet and so they did not know if theirs was rare, and at the same time the site can help people who deal with pattern-based skins in general. <br />This page should at least somewhat solve these problems</p>
